# About Me

I'm a Project Coordinator and Team Lead with over three years of experience in business operations and project management. I've completed four projects, drawing on my background as an analyst for over two years. My expertise is backed by a Bachelor's degree in Commerce with Honors from Delhi University and professional certifications in Data Analytics, Project Management, and Business Intelligence.

Outside of my professional life, I'm a freelance data analyst for a YouTube channel and share my knowledge through Medium blogs. I'm also a Google Certified professional in Project Management, Data Analytics, and Business Intelligence, leading projects full-time.

Beyond the numbers, I express my creativity as a skilled sketch artist, making data visually appealing. When not immersed in data, I enjoy exploring new places, combining my passion for travel with my dedication to data.

Whether analyzing data, sketching, or sharing insights, I'm always eager to contribute to the world of data and beyond.
